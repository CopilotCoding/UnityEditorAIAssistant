Simply drag and drop the Editor folder into your Assets folder in your unity project.

You will get a new window option available called AI Assistant. You will also get a new editor preferences tab called AI Assistant where you can enter your api key.

I gave it the instruction "- Assume the Unity version is 6000.0.58f1 as reference." but feel free to change that to your unity version.
